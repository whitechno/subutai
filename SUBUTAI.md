#### Subutai (1175–1248) 
 
Classical Mongolian: Sübügätäi or Sübü'ätäi;  
Tuvan: Сүбэдэй;  
Modern Mongolian: Subotai, Сүбээдэй, Sübedei;  
Chinese: 速不台    

Subutai was an Uriankhai general, and the primary military strategist of Genghis Khan 
and Ögedei Khan. He directed more than 20 campaigns in which he conquered 32 nations 
and won 65 pitched battles, during which he conquered or overran more territory than 
any other commander in history. He gained victory by means of imaginative and 
sophisticated strategies and routinely coordinated movements of armies that were 
hundreds of kilometers away from each other. He is also remembered for devising the 
campaign that destroyed the armies of Hungary and Poland within two days of each other, 
by forces over 500 kilometers apart.

Subutai seems to have been identified from early on by Temujin as special, and given rare 
opportunities for growth. Appointed to the prestigious post of Genghis Khan's ger (yurt) 
door guard during his teen years, Mongol histories say that Subutai said to Genghis Khan, 
"I will ward off your enemies as felt cloth protects one from the wind." 
This access enabled him to listen on, and later join, the Mongol strategy meetings somewhere 
around his late teens and early twenties. Throughout most of Genghis Khan's lifetime, 
Subutai would have the opportunity to apprentice on detached missions under the elite Jebe 
(1211–12, 1213–14, 1219–23) and Muqali (1213–14), in addition to Genghis Khan himself (1219). 
It is likely that his unique access to the most brilliant Mongol leaders assisted his growth.

Subutai's first chance at independent command came in 1197, when he was just 22 years old. 
This boon occurred during the war against Genghis Khan's most hated enemy, the Merkit. 
Subutai's role was to act as the vanguard and defeat one of the Merkit camps at the 
Tchen River. Subutai refused Genghis Khan's offer for extra elite troops, and instead 
traveled to the Merkit camp alone, posing as a Mongol deserter. Subutai managed to convince 
the Merkits that the main Mongol army was far away, and they were in no danger. As a result, 
the Merkit lowered their guard and limited their patrols, allowing the Mongols to easily 
surprise and encircle the Merkits, capturing two generals. This is evidence that even in 
his formative years, Subutai was a highly unorthodox general who found innovative ways 
to cheaply solve problems with few casualties.

Subutai was a major innovator in the art of war, and his later campaigns demonstrated an 
unprecedented level of complexity and strategy not seen again until World War II. In the 
invasions of China, Russia, and Europe, Subutai routinely coordinated armies of ~100,000 men 
across frontages separated by 500-1,000 km and between 3 and 5 separate army groups. These 
maneuvers were highly synchronized despite the enormous distances: the Mongols defeated the 
main army of Poland and Hungary in separate battles two days apart. Subutai's maneuvers were 
designed to mislead his foes and strike them from unexpected directions. The Mongol invasion 
of the Jin in 1232 continually pulled the hitherto successful Jin forces apart despite their 
highly advantageous terrain, as they could not determine which Mongol armies were the feints 
and which were the true threats until their main army became isolated and starved. Strongly 
fortified locations would be bypassed and ignored until all organized resistance had been 
destroyed. Sieges would be limited to critical or vulnerable locations; in other situations, 
the Mongols either left a blockading force, or simply ignored fortified citadels and 
devastated the surrounded agriculture so that the remaining people would starve if they 
remained within fortified walls.

Due to his long tenure of service, Subutai had the opportunity to face off against elite armies 
of all types from west to east, and emerged triumphant in every campaign. The horse archers of 
other great steppe confederacies, the elite Jurchen cavalry of China in the 1230s, the seasoned 
Qangli Turk cavalry of the Khwarezm, fresh from conquering their own Empire, and the heavily 
armored knights of Georgia, Poland, and Hungary were all powerless against Subutai's armies. 
In contrast to the common perception of steppe horse archer armies slowly weakening their foes 
with arrows for many hours or even days, such as at the battle of Carrhae or the battle of 
Manzikert, Subutai fought in a much more decisive and fluid manner where heavy firepower was 
used to create openings for rapid cavalry charges with deep formations. At the battle of the 
Kalka River in 1223, Subutai's 20,000 man army routed the 80,000 man Russian army by stringing 
it out after a 9-day retreat, and then immediately turning and delivering a decisive charge 
without a prolonged missile bombardment. The vanguard of the Russian army was already put in 
flight before the second wave even reached the battlefield and began to deploy.

Subutai was one of the first Mongol generals, alongside Genghis Khan, who realized the value of 
engineers in siege warfare. Even in field battles he made use of siege engines. In the Battle 
of Mohi, the Hungarian crossbowmen repelled a night bridge crossing by the Mongols, and 
inflicted considerable casualties on the Mongols fighting to cross the river the following day. 
Subutai ordered huge stonethrowers to clear the bank of Hungarian crossbowmen and open the way 
for his light cavalry to cross the river without further losses. This use of siege weapons was 
one of the first recorded uses of artillery bombardments against the enemy army to disrupt 
their resistance while simultaneously attacking them. In execution, his usage functioned more 
akin to the creeping barrage of World War I, used to soften and disrupt enemy lines right 
before an attack. While the stonethrowers were clearing the path to cross the main bridge, 
Subutai supervised construction of another temporary bridge downriver to outflank the Hungarians. 
The Hungarians, focused on the attack at the bridge and knowing that the Sajo river was too 
deep to ford, did not expect the Mongols to be able to create a pontoon bridge, especially at 
night. Subutai's engineering ingenuity extended to the totally unique use of smokescreens to 
shroud key areas of the battlefield. At the battle of the Kalka and the battle of Liegnitz, 
the Mongol armies drew portions of their foes armies away from their comrades, and used smoke 
to obscure the enemy vision and prevent them from seeing their isolated units encircled and 
destroyed.

Subutai was also well known for incorporating conquered peoples who brought specialized skills 
into his forces, especially engineers. He was skilled at intelligence gathering and planning 
his campaigns well in advance. For instance, he used spies to gather detailed information on 
the Russian principalities, the Poles, and the Hungarians at least a year before the attacks 
on each. His European adversaries were stunned by the intricacy of the Mongol espionage 
networks. He tailored his strategy to match the enemy, adjusting his tactics according to the 
opponents, the terrain, and the weather as required. He emphasized the use of light cavalry in 
his army, maneuvering the enemy into feints and ambushes, and efficiently pursuing and 
defeating broken armies to destroy further resistance. Subutai kept his forces in line with 
the Mongol tradition of dispensing with excess baggage train and ensured 
his troops could efficiently live off the land and rapidly advance great distances on campaign. 
He preferred to maneuver the enemy into a position of weakness before committing to battle. 
Subutai was very vigilant about conserving Mongol lives, and would devise elaborate strategic 
maneuvers or conduct frequent massacres to terrorize populations into submission so as to limit 
future casualties.

Like Genghis Khan, Subutai was a master at creating divisions within the enemy ranks and 
surprising them. The terrifying Mongol reputation, combined with highly effective spy networks 
that spread discord, as well as incentives to key local leaders, prevented his opponents from 
effectively uniting and fighting at their full capacity. Oftentimes enemy resistance simply 
collapsed when the Mongols drew near, or they were simply paralyzed and didn't take action 
in time. When attacking the Merkits, Subutai repeatedly deceived them into thinking his armies 
were far away, only to surprise and surround them. In Khwarezm, the Mongols created a rift 
between the forces loyal to the Shah's mother and the Shah's own armies, all while harrying 
the Shah to prevent him from fixing the situation and rallying armies. In Georgia, civilian 
massacres lured King George IV's army into the open, while north of the Caucasus, clever 
diplomacy splitting the alliance between the nomadic Cumans and the local Alans and Circassians.
