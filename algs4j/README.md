Algorithms Fourth Edition
=========================

This fourth edition of Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne’s Algorithms is the leading
textbook on algorithms today and is widely used in colleges and universities
worldwide. This book surveys the most important computer algorithms currently in use
and provides a full treatment of data structures and algorithms for sorting,
searching, graph processing, and string processing--including fifty algorithms every
programmer should know. In this edition, new Java implementations are written in an
accessible modular programming style, where all of the code is exposed to the reader
and ready to use.

The algorithms in this book represent a body of knowledge developed over the last 50
years that has become indispensable, not just for professional programmers and
computer science students but for any student with interests in science, mathematics,
and engineering, not to mention students who use computation in the liberal arts.

The MOOC related to this book is accessible via the "Online Course"
link at [algs4.cs.princeton.edu](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/). The course
offers more than 100 video lecture segments that are integrated with the text,
extensive online assessments, and the large-scale discussion forums that have proven
so valuable. Offered each fall and spring, this course regularly attracts tens of
thousands of registrants.

Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne are developing a modern approach to disseminating
knowledge that fully embraces technology, enabling people all around the world to
discover new ways of learning and teaching. By integrating their textbook, online
content, and MOOC, all at the state of the art, they have built a unique resource
that greatly expands the breadth and depth of the educational experience.

Robert Sedgewick has been a Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University
since 1985, where he was the founding Chairman of the Department of Computer Science.
He has held visiting research positions at Xerox PARC, Institute for Defense
Analyses, and INRIA, and is member of the board of directors of Adobe Systems.
Professor Sedgewick’s research interests include analytic combinatorics, design and
analysis of data structures and algorithms, and program visualization. His landmark
book, Algorithms, now in its fourth edition, has appeared in numerous versions and
languages over the past thirty years. In addition, with Kevin Wayne, he is the
coauthor of the highly acclaimed textbook, Introduction to Programming in Java: An
Interdisciplinary Approach (Addison-Wesley, 2008).

Kevin Wayne is the Phillip Y. Goldman Senior Lecturer in Computer Science at
Princeton University, where he has been teaching since 1998. He received a Ph.D. in
operations research and industrial engineering from Cornell University. His research
interests include the design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms, especially
for graphs and discrete optimization. With Robert Sedgewick, he is the coauthor of
the highly acclaimed textbook, Introduction to Programming in Java: An
Interdisciplinary Approach (Addison-Wesley, 2008).
