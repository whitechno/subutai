# subutai
Experiments with SBT.

### Simplest SBT project setup (with new github repo)
1. Create repository (like `subutai`)
2. In it `touch build.sbt`
3. Create `project/build.properties` with the following content: 
`sbt.version = 1.3.9`. Use `sbt> reboot` if changed.
4. If needed, add `.gitignore` and `LICENSE`

Now you can clone this new repository on your desktop with  
`git clone https://github.com/whitechno/subutai.git`,  
and open and edit it with your favorite IDE.

### Set scala version(s) in build.sbt
Add this line to build.sbt:  
`ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "2.13.1"`  

As of Mar 27, 2020   
Scala:  
2.13.1  - Sep 18, 2019  
2.12.11 - Mar 16, 2020  
2.12.10 - Sep 10, 2019  
2.11.12 - Nov 9, 2017  
2.10.7  - Nov 9, 2017  
SBT:  
1.3.10 - Apr 14, 2020  
1.3.9  - Mar 31, 2020  
1.3.8  - Feb 3, 2020  

Now you have a minimal setup to start using Scala with SBT.

You can also switch scalaVersion temporarily:  
`sbt:Hello>  ++2.12.11! -v`  
`!` is to force version switch (without it, 
the switch happens only in projects where this particular version is included 
in `crossScalaVersions` of project `settings`)  
`-v` is for verbose

## Important techniques

### Checking SBT, Scala, Java version
SBT:  
`> sbt about`  
`> sbt -v`  
`> sbt sbtVersion`  

Scala:  
`> sbt scalaVersion`

To see which version of Java does SBT use:  
`> sbt "eval System.getProperty(\"java.version\")" "eval System.getProperty(\"java.home\")"`  
or in sbt shell:  
`sbt:subutai> eval System.getProperty("java.version")`   
`sbt:subutai> eval System.getProperty("java.home")`  

### clean;compile;test;run
Run one particular main class:  
`sbt:subutai> runMain example.Hello`

For code in `test` folder:  
`sbt:subutai> test:compile`

Run one particular main class in `test` folder of `scalaVersions` project:  
`sbt:subutai> scalaVersions / test:runMain example.scalaVersions.TestScalaVersionsMain`

Run one particular test class (of "scalatest" kind):  
`sbt:subutai> testOnly example.HelloSpec`

### Package

`sbt:hocon> package` to generate JAR in 
`target/scala-2.12/hocon_2.12-0.1.0.jar`  
You can list its contents with the usual jar tvf command:
```text
$ jar tvf target/scala-2.12/hocon_2.12-0.1.0.jar
   271 Wed Apr 29 19:15:58 PDT 2020 META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
     0 Wed Apr 29 19:15:58 PDT 2020 example/
     0 Wed Apr 29 19:15:58 PDT 2020 example/hocon/
   854 Wed Apr 29 19:14:24 PDT 2020 example/hocon/ReadConfigurationFile.class
  1020 Wed Apr 29 19:14:24 PDT 2020 example/hocon/ReadConfigurationFile$.class
   130 Wed Apr 29 19:15:58 PDT 2020 lightbend.conf
```

### Assembly
https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly  
Add 
`addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-assembly" % "0.14.10")` 
to `project/plugins.sbt`  
0.14.10 - Jul 11, 2019

`sbt:hocon> assembly` to generate assembly JAR in 
`target/scala-2.12/hocon-assembly-0.1.0.jar`  
You can list its contents with the usual jar tvf command:
```text
$ jar tvf target/scala-2.12/hocon-assembly-0.1.0.jar
```

Add `test in assembly := {}` to project settings 
to skip the test during assembly.

To exclude Scala library 
(JARs that start with `scala-` and are included in the binary 
Scala distribution) 
to run with `scala` command:
```text
assemblyOption in assembly := (assemblyOption in assembly).value.copy(includeScala = false)
```

To make a JAR file containing only the external dependencies, type  
`> assemblyPackageDependency`  
This is intended to be used with a JAR that only contains your project:
```text
assemblyOption in assembly := (assemblyOption in assembly).value.copy(includeScala = false, includeDependency = false)

```

### Cross-building
https://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Cross-Build.html

The underlying mechanism used to indicate which version of Scala a library 
was compiled against is to append `_<scala-binary-version>` to the libraryâ€™s name. 
For example, the artifact name `dispatch-core_2.12` is used 
when compiled against Scala 2.12.0, 2.12.1 or any 2.12.x version. 
This fairly simple approach allows interoperability with users of 
Maven, Ant and other build tools.

Define the versions of Scala to build against in the `crossScalaVersions` setting. 
Versions of Scala 2.10.2 or later are allowed.

*Note:* `crossScalaVersions` must be set to Nil on the root project 
(or all aggregating projects) to avoid double publishing.

To build against all versions listed in `crossScalaVersions`, 
prefix the action to run with `+`. For example:  
`> + test`

You can use `++ <version> [command]` to temporarily switch the Scala version 
currently being used to build the subprojects given that `<version>` is listed 
in their `crossScalaVersions`.

When a `[command]` is passed in to `++`, it will execute the command on the 
subprojects that supports the given `<version>`.

Sometimes you might want to force the Scala version switch regardless of the 
`crossScalaVersions` values. 
You can use `++ <version>!` with exclamation mark for that. For example:  
`> ++ 2.13.0-M5! -v`

### Scala Worksheets in IntelliJ

"Use compile server for Scala" tick box is in  
`Preferences > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Scala Compiler > Scala Compile Server`  
you can also get to this view from the speedometer-like icon 
in the bottom right of IntelliJ, 
which can be used to Stop/Run Scala Compile Server.

"Run worksheet in the compiler process" tick box is in  
`Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > Scala > Worksheet (tab)`  
A typical way to use this feature is to do development on a single Scala version 
(no `+` prefix) and then cross-build (using `+`) occasionally and when releasing.

#### Experiments
All experiments below are with
"Make project before run": On

Experiment 1  
Run type: REPL  
"Use compile server for Scala": On  
"Run worksheet in the compiler process": On  
Result: doesn't pick the change even with restart

Experiment 2  
Run type: REPL  
"Use compile server for Scala": On  
"Run worksheet in the compiler process": Off  
Result: doesn't pick the change even with restart

Experiment 3  
Run type: REPL  
"Use compile server for Scala": Off  
Result: REPL doesn't work in this mode at all

Experiment 4  
Run type: Plain  
"Use compile server for Scala": On  
"Run worksheet in the compiler process": On  
Result: picks the change after restart

Experiment 5  
Run type: Plain  
"Use compile server for Scala": On  
"Run worksheet in the compiler process": Off  
Result: always picks the change, no need to restart

Experiment 6  
Run type: Plain  
"Use compile server for Scala": Off  
Result: always picks the change (feels a tiny bit slower)

#### Final recommendations.
For dev/test/debug cycle:  
"Make project before run": On  
Run type: Plain  
"Use compile server for Scala": On  
"Run worksheet in the compiler process": Off

For exploring stable libraries:  
"Make project before run": On (?)  
Run type: REPL  
"Use compile server for Scala": On  
"Run worksheet in the compiler process": On

### SBT by example
See and try https://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/sbt-by-example.html

In the `subutai` directory create nested directories and `.scala` file:  
`src/main/scala/example/Hello.scala`  
In SBT shell:  
`sbt:Hello> clean;compile;test;run`

## Special topics

### Slow start because of "Getting the hostname ... was slow"
Sometimes the startup time for test and run might be pretty long and you might see 
the following command:  
`[warn] Getting the hostname Olegs-MacBook-Pro was slow (18020.887197 ms). 
This is likely because the computer's hostname is not set. You can set the hostname with the command: scutil --set HostName $(scutil --get LocalHostName).`

I found the following solution.

I used to have:
```
$ scutil --get HostName
Olegs-MacBook-Pro
$ scutil --get LocalHostName
Olegs-MacBook-Pro
$ time python -c 'import socket; socket.getfqdn()'
  real	0m18.134s
  user	0m0.037s
  sys	0m0.025s
```

Then I changed:
```text
$ sudo scutil --set HostName Olegs-MacBook-Pro.local
    real    0m0.047s
    user    0m0.030s
    sys     0m0.012s
```
and then added into `/etc/hosts`
```text
127.0.0.1   localhost Olegs-MacBook-Pro.local
::1         localhost Olegs-MacBook-Pro.local
```

### Use sbt-native-packager to create .zip distribution
In `project/plugins.sbt` add:  
`addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-native-packager" % "1.3.4")`  
In `build.sbt` add:  
`.enablePlugins(JavaAppPackaging)`
In SBT shell:
```
sbt:Hello> reload
sbt:Hello> dist
```
In terminal shell:
```
> unzip -o -d /tmp/someother /tmp/foo-build/target/universal/hello-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip
> /tmp/someother/hello-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/hello
```

### [warn] There may be incompatibilities among your library dependencies; run 'evicted' to see detailed eviction warnings.
With some plugins (like `sbt-native-packager`), sbt might show eviction warning on sbt shell start,
however `> evicted` command shows nothing.

Remember that [SBT is recursive](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Organizing-Build.html#sbt+is+recursive) - 
that means, SBT uses SBT to build the SBT used to build your project.

The eviction warning you are seeing is not for your main project, but for the meta-project!
You can check that by running the evicted command in the meta project using the `reload plugins` command.
To return to the main project execute the `reload return` command
```
$ sbt

### Is it wise to fix eviction warnings of library dependencies?
Is it a good idea to fix SBT eviction warning messages using `dependencyOverrides` in build.sbt 
as per [SBT Documentation Eviction warning](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Library-Management.html#Eviction+warning)?

If these warnings are for dependencies you use directly in your code, 
you should definitely add the upgraded version to your libraryDependencies.

For evicted transitive dependencies (those dependencies only used directly by your own dependencies), 
it's likely best to simply leave the warnings in place. This provides documentation to you about 
possible incompatibilities in your dependencies, and could help you debug runtime problems that 
arise due to such incompatibilities.

Remember, setting dependencyOverrides merely hides the warning, 
it doesn't guarantee compatibility between your libraries and the version you set.
