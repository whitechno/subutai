Experiments with SBT

### Simplest SBT project setup
1. Create repository (like `subutai`)
2. In it `touch build.sbt`
3. Create `project/build.properties` with the following content: `sbt.version = 1.3.4` (as of November 23, 2019)
4. If needed, add `.gitignore`
Now you can clone this new repository on your desktop with `git clone https://github.com/whitechno/subutai.git`,
and open and edit it with your favorite IDE.
